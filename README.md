## Description

This project is refactoring an existing code to improve it without changing its functionality and making it accessible. The purpose of this project is to meet a certain set of standards or to implement new technology for users. 

The motivation behind this project is to showcase the ability to refactor code, which is an essential task for front-end and back-end developers. Refactoring helps to improve the codebase and make it more efficient.

The problem solved by this project is to make the code more accessible for people with disabilities, such as screen readers. In addition, it makes the code more search engine friendly by improving the semantic structure of the HTML code.

Through this project, I learned the importance of code refactoring, how to refactor code without changing its functionality, and how to improve the accessibility and search engine optimization of the code.
